## Cost of living Calculator

## Project Description

My app is a cost of living calculator. This app will help you make better financial decisions when you are trying to relocate. Users can add their current location, future location, and household income to see the difference in price. In the future, I would like to add drop-downs for housing, transportation, food, healthcare costs, and others.
